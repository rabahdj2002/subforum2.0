## Introduction
**SubForum 2.0** is a platform designed for students to submit their projects, which are then reviewed by the teacher (admin). The goal of the project is to build a fully functional web application where students can submit their project details, including project name, description, and any files, while the teacher can manage, review, and monitor these submissions.

This project is built with Django as the backend framework, MySQL as the database, and a custom frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
